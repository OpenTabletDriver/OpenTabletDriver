        Export diagnostics through the OpenTabletDriver GUI from menu <kbd>Help</kbd> â†’ <kbd>Export Diagnostics</kbd>.
        Then, in the text area below, either attach the file\* or paste its contents\*\*.

        **If you are not able to export diagnostics** for some reason (i.e., crashes), then **paste a stack trace
        if you got one**, or just type "N/A" if there's simply nothing else you can contribute.

        \*: You may need to rename the file to have a `.txt` extension for GitHub to allow uploading it.
        \*\*: If pasting diagnostics, it would be helpful to use a JSON code block, as you can see in the placeholder text below.

        ```json
        <paste file contents>
