# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for showing interest in the development of OpenTabletDriver!

As we transition to replacing our UI to `avalonia`, the `master` branch is now feature-locked, as its features has been integrated into the `avalonia` branch, and the old UI (Eto) is carried on on the `0.6.x` branch.

To help us avoid conflicts later, please direct all new pull requests to the `0.6.x` or `avalonia` branch moving forward.

Configurations should be targeted for `0.6.x`, and only submitted to `avalonia` if the tablet is already supported in `0.6.x`.

Please see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file from the individual branches for more details on how to contribute.
